Each location on map is clickable and may contain an army or fleet. Overlay arrows for prepared orders.
    Move arrow: directed from A to B
    Support arrow: directed from A to B and dashed to C
    Hold: circle around unit
    Convoy: non-directed arrow from A to C through B (current location)
    Build: + sign

    Retreat: directed from A to B

    If multiple arrows from A to B then spread them.
